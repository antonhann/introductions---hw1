                <p>
                    I really enjoy software developing, I have experience in working with React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js, HTML/CSS, Django, Flask, and Javascript / Typescript.
                    I also really enjoy solving leetcode problems, as I prepare for technical interviews. A goal I have is to finish my personal projects, and deploy them for the world to see!

                <h1>Rock Climbing!</h1>
                <p>
                    I started rock climbing this summer and I am really enjoying it since. I am currently climbing at a V4 level, where the grading difficulty goes from v0 to v16.
                    I am currently working on my technique and strength to climb harder routes. I am also looking to get into outdoor climbing and lead climbing soon!

                <h1>Music / Concerts</h1>
                <p>
                    I really enjoy music, I have lots of genres I like to listen to, like rnb, kpop, rap, nostalgic music, and more. 
                    I like to listen to music everywhere I go, whether its at the gym, on my run, coding, or just relaxing. 
                    I been to a lot of concerts, so far only been to kpop concerts, but I am going to be exploring the edm / rap scene soon!
